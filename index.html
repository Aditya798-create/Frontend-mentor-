    <h2> Received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
    <h5> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br> transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ” </h5>

    <h2>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy. </h2>
    <h5> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the  rest. You will get the <br> personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”  </h5>

    <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </h2>
    <h5> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”  </h5>
